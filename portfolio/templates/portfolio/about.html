        Hello! I'm Bibek Bhattarai, a passionate full-stack developer with experience in front-end and back-end
        development. I enjoy building responsive, user-friendly applications and solving complex problems with
        technology.
        <br><br>
        I completed my <strong>+2 in Science in 2019</strong>, where I developed an interest in technology. This passion led me to pursue a 
        <strong>Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Information Technology (BSc CSIT), which I completed in 2024</strong>. 
        Through my studies, I gained a solid foundation in programming, web development, and problem-solving, which I now apply in my work as a full-stack developer.
        <br><br>
        My goal is to keep learning, take on exciting projects, and contribute to meaningful innovations in web
        development.
